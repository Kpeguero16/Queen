        <h2> ABOUT </h2>
        <p>Few bands embodied the fearless creativity and attitude of 1970s
            rock like Queen. Embracing the exaggerated pomp of prog rock
            and heavy metal and the quaintness of vaudevillian music hall in
            equal measure, the British quartet colored their complex
            arrangements with camp and bombast, creating a huge, mock-
            operatic sound layered with guitars and overdubbed vocals. For
            years, their albums boasted the motto "no synthesizers were used
            on this record," signaling their allegiance with post-
            <a href="https://open.spotify.com/artist/36QJpDe2go2KgaRleHCDTp?si=6PPFL_61QzSH3E16TSt1Mw" target="_blank">Led Zeppelin</a>
            hard rock bands. But balancing this seriousness, vocalist 
            <a href="https://open.spotify.com/artist/4M1FpEWs2PeYfJe7xxJfhH?si=5oVF5QIoQWSgFVCenPx7Vg" target="_blank">Freddie Mercury</a> 
            brought an extravagant sense of fun to Queen, pushing
            them toward kitschy humor and pseudo-classical arrangements as
            epitomized in their best-known song, "Bohemian Rhapsody."
            Blessed with an extensive range and perfect pitch, 
            <a href="https://open.spotify.com/artist/4M1FpEWs2PeYfJe7xxJfhH?si=5oVF5QIoQWSgFVCenPx7Vg" target="_blank">Mercury</a> 
            was one of the most charismatic and technically gifted rock singers of
            his generation, his larger-than-life reputation bolstered by a wry,
            outspoken sense of humor and an array of era-defining stage
            costumes. Through his legendary theatrical performances, Queen
            became one of the most popular bands in the world in the mid-70s,
            topping the charts in England and regularly cracking the Billboard
            200 Top Ten with albums like 1975's A Night at the Opera, 1976's A
            Day at the Races, and 1977's News of the World. They also shifted
            stylistic gears seemingly at will, dipping into funk and disco; a trait
            that helped make sons like 1980's bass-driven "Another One Bites the Dust" 
            into worldwide hits. The band retained a fanatical
            following into the '80s, earning three number one albums in the U.K X
            with 1980's The Game, 1986's A Kind of Magic, and 1989's The
            Miracle. They garnered yet more pop culture fame along the way,
            gleefully supplying the soundtracks to sci-fi action films like Flash
            Gordon and The Highlander. Though

            's death from complications due to AIDS in 1991 brought Queen's initial reign to a close 
            (his final album being the posthumously released Made in Heaven), their influence 
            continued to be heard in the generations of artists and bands that followed, from

            presence in music, and in 2018 were subject of the Oscar-winning
            biopic Bohemian Rhapsody,</p>

            The origins of Queen lay in the hard rock psychedelic group Smile,
            which guitarist

            joined in 1967. Following the departure of Smile's lead vocalist,

            , in 1971, 
            <a href="https://open.spotify.com/artist/2NcbLU1bW55eahD0UgD7U3?si=I9UPWkXiTKO2OdqH7mj-3w" target="_blank">May</a>

            formed a group with Freddie Mercury, the former lead singer 
            for Wreckage. Within a few months, bassist John Deacon joined them, and they began 
            rehearsing. Over the next two years, as all four members completed college, they simply 
            rehearsed, playing just a handful of gigs. By 1973, they had begun to concentrate on their 
            career, releasing their debut album, Queen, that year and setting out on their first tour. 
            Produced by the band, along with Roy Thomas Baker and John Anthony, Queen was more or less 
            a straight metal album and drew favorable comparisons to Led Zeppelin.
